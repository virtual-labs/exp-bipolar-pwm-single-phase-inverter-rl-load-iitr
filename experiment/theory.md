### **Introduction**

A bipolar PWM single-phase inverter is a type of power electronic device used to convert DC (direct current) power into AC (alternating current) power with a single-phase output. It utilizes a pulse width modulation (PWM) technique to control the switching of power semiconductor devices, typically insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) or MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors).<br>

The bipolar PWM inverter produces an AC output waveform by switching the DC input voltage between positive and negative polarities. It generates the desired AC output voltage by varying the width of the pulses while maintaining a fixed frequency. By adjusting the pulse width, the inverter can regulate the amplitude of the output voltage, the operation of a bipolar PWM single-phase inverter involves dividing the input DC voltage into several voltage levels and then applying suitable pulse width modulation techniques to obtain the desired AC output waveform. This is achieved by comparing a reference sinusoidal waveform with a triangular waveform generated by a carrier signal. The inverter generates the necessary pulses to approximate the reference waveform based on the comparison.

### **Pulse-Width Modulated Inverters**

PWM Inverter uses PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) technique to control the output voltage of the inverter, this is done to fulfill the AC load requirements. In PWM inverter the controlled output is obtained by adjusting the ON and OFF period of the inverter components.
Pulse-width modulation is used in inverters for the purpose of regulating the amplitude and the frequency of the output voltage. In the inverter circuits, it is even more complex because it is required that one obtains approximately sinusoidal voltage of a preassigned frequency (usually 50 or 60 Hz) at its output.
The pulse-width-modulated (PWM) inverters use a harmonic control (modulating) signal, whereas the carrier signal is triangular.<br><br>
 A PWM module consists of:<br>
• a sinusoidal oscillator with a frequency f<sub>1</sub> (normally 50 or 60 Hz) which generates the control signal.<br>
• a generator of triangular voltage (carrier signal) whose frequency fs is several times higher than f<sub>1.</sub><br>
• a comparator with complementary outputs as shown in Fig. 2.<br>

The pulse frequency at the comparator output is equal to the frequency of the carrier signal f<sub>s</sub>, and the duration of the pulses depends on the ratio of the instantaneous values of the voltages of the control and carrier signals.
Since these pulses control the states of the inverter switches,
the switches will also operate at the frequency f<sub>s</sub> modulated by the ratio of the turn-on and the turn-off time. Consequently, it follows that

Since the output voltage varies between +V<sub>DC</sub> and –V<sub>DC</sub> and vice-versa so the PWM technique are called bipolar modulators.
Because the frequency of the carrier signal is much higher than the frequency of the sinusoidal control signal, i.e., f<sub>s</sub> >> f<sub>1</sub>.

It may be assumed that the control voltage V<sub>c</sub> during the cycle T<sub>s</sub> is approximately constant. Then, based on Fig. 3, the average value of the output voltage is<br>

<center>

$V_{oav} = \frac {1}{T_s} \biggr[ \int_{t_1}^{T_s-t_1}-V_{DC} \, dt + \int_{T_s-t_1}^{T_s+t_1}V_{DC} dt \biggr].........(1)$

</center>

Because in the interval  0 &le; t &le; $T_s$ : $V_{tr} = −V_{tM}+ (\frac {4V_{tM}}{T_s})t$, from the condition $V_{tr}(t1) = V_c$ 

It follows that

<center>

$t_1 = \frac {T_s}{4} \biggr(1+ \frac {V_c}{V_{tM}} \biggr).......(2)$

</center>

From equation (1) and (2) it follows that<br>

<center>

$V_{oav} = \frac {V_{c}}{V_{tM}}V_{DC}.........(3)$

</center>

Here V<sub>tM</sub>is maximum value of triangular wave<br>

If 

<center>

$V_c = V_{cM} \, sin(\omega t).........(4)$

</center>

Here V<sub>cM</sub>is maximum value of carrier wave <br>

Then

<center>

$V_{oav} = \frac {V_{cM}}{V_{tM}}V_{DC} sin(\omega t) = m_aV_{DC} sin(\omega t).........(5)$

</center>

Where,<br>

<center>

$m_a= \frac {V_{cM}}{V_{tM}} ..........(6)$

</center>

Here $m_a$ is the factor of amplitude modulation, equal to the ratio of the sinusoidal control
signal and the triangular carrier signal. On the basis of Equation (5) one can draw a very
important conclusion that the average value of the output voltage is a sinusoidal
function having the frequency of the control signals f<sub>1</sub> (dashed line in Fig. 4 (b))
and the amplitude

<center>

$V_{oM} = m_a V_{DC} \le V_{DC}..........(7)$

</center>

because the amplitude modulation factor $m_a$ < 1.<br><br>
In addition to the factor of amplitude modulation we must remember the harmonics frequency is given by

<center>

$f_h = h.f_1 ..........(8)$

</center>

Where f<sub>h</sub> is harmonic frequency, f<sub>1</sub> is fundamental frequency<br>

Here h = 3, 5, 7, 9..........<br>
            
As far as harmonic is concern

<center>

$h = (j.m_f \pm k)$

</center>

where m<sub>f</sub> is an carrier ratio i.e.,

<center>

$m_f = \frac {f_s}{f_1} ..........(9)$

</center>

where f<sub>s</sub> is switching frequency and f<sub>1</sub> is fundamental frequency.<br>
So

<center>

$f_h = (j.m_f \pm k) f_1 ..........(10)$

</center>

<b>Note:</b>For odd value of j, k will be even and for even value of j, k will be odd value.<br>

<center><b>Fig. 4 Voltage waveforms (a and b) and frequency spectrum of the inverter based on bipolar PWM (c)</b></center><br>

Even though mf >> 1, the control signal is not constant within one cycle T<sub>s</sub>. For
this reason the output voltage will contain higher harmonics, whereas (5) gives
its fundamental harmonic. The higher harmonics appear around the carrier frequency as shown in Fig. 4(c) and its integer multiples, more precisely around the harmonics mf, 2mf, 3mf, … For instance, if mf = 15, harmonics 15, 17, 13, …, 31, 33, 29, etc. will exist.
